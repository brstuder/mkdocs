# Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Brett, and this my online portfolio.

This portfolio was built in GitHub and Visual Studio Code, written in Markdown, CSS, and Mkdocs Material, and hosted via GitHub Pages to demonstrate proficiency with syntax languages, static site generators, and version control tooling. You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/brstuder/mkdocs/tree/main). For now this is a professional showcase of my writing work, but over time I plan to expand the functionality and scope of this page as I continue to build web development skills.

I recommend to new visitors to start with my [Kubecost](kubecost/kubecost-overview.md) and [MobiledgeX](mobiledgex/mobiledgex.md) projects for a deep insight into the technical documentation and other multimedia I've developed over my career.
