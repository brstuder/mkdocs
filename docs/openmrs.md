# OpenMRS
*May 2021 - November 2021*

As part of Google's Season of Docs program ([which has since been discontinued](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs)), I worked half a year with OpenMRS. Our objective was to improve the efficiency and clarity of new user onboarding, allowing users to get set up and find a project within the group they could immediately start contributing to.

## Key Projects

### Guide for the New and Curious

My first and most significant contribution to OpenMRS would be a significant overhaul to their [Guide for the New and Curious](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/25477628/Guide+for+the+New+and+Curious). This is the first stop for new contributors, and we aimed to simplify the onboarding process, and point them to internal teams and projects they could immediately contribute towards.

### Project Page Template

OpenMRS is made up of open-source groups and projects which have their own internal communities with team leaders and objectives. I designed this simple [project page template](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RES/pages/26267259/Project+Page+Template) which allows new teams to get started quickly by allowing them to build their homepages effectively, while also boosting consistency in project pages across the entire organization.
