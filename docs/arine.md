# Arine

*April 2025 - Present*

 Currently I serve as a solo technical writer at Arine, a healthcare optimization platform that is primarily developed for pharmacists, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals. I sadly can't discuss too much about my current work or post writing samples, but would be happy to discuss more about my projects face to face.
