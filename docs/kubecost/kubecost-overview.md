# Kubecost
*June 2022 - June 2024*

Kubecost is a SaaS startup focused on providing cost visibility for cloud service spend in the Kubernetes space, and was acquired by IBM in 2024. For two years, I served as the company's first and only technical writer, as well as the primary maintainer of the company's documentation repository. I have also contributed to company blog posts, release notes, API docs, and architecture diagrams.

I oversaw our live docs site, [docs.kubecost.com](https://docs.kubecost.com/) (which has since been ported to IBM's web domain), a site receiving 40,000 monthly users and acted as the primary maintainer and contributor. Responsibilities and accomplishments include:

* Increased total number of docs by 91%, and increased annual organic traffic to docs by 43%
* Reduced outstanding user tickets in our GitHub repository by 59% to address key user feedback
* Provided internal company training for our site generator tool GitBook across 7 teams and departments to increase internal docs contributors by 31%.
* Implemented automated maintenance of our main docs repo, including auto-assigning user tickets and scanning for broken links on every PR before being merged, allowing for a cleaner and more well-regulated workspace for all contributors.

You can see writing samples which include API documentation, install guides, custom software configurations, and Kubernetes concepts. Content was written in Markdown format, published through GitHub, and rendered via GitBook's frontend.

You can also see architecture diagrams [here](diagrams.md), created with draw.io.
