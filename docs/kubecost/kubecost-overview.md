# Kubecost
*June 2022 - May 2024*

As the primary technical writer for Kubecost, a growing SaaS startup focused on providing cost visibility for cloud service spend in the Kubernetes space, I've served for two years as our primary documentation owner and maintainer. I have also contributed to company blog posts, release notes, API docs, and architecture diagrams.

Content was originally developed through a combination of GitHub, GitBook, draw.io, Adobe, Postman, and other select dev tools.

I oversaw our live docs site, [docs.kubecost.com](https://docs.kubecost.com/) (which has since been ported to IBM's web domain), a site receiving 40,000 monthly users and acted as the primary maintainer and contributor. Responsibilities and accomplishments include:

* Increased total number of docs by 91%, and increased annual organic traffic to docs by 43%
* Reduced outstanding user tickets in our GitHub repository by 59% to address key user feedback
* Provided internal company training for our site generator tool GitBook across 7 teams and departments to increase internal docs contributors by 31%.
* Implemented automated maintenance of our main docs repo, including auto-assigning user tickets and scanning for broken links on every PR before being merged, allowing for a cleaner and more well-regulated workspace for all contributors.

You can see writing samples which include API documentation, install guides, custom software configurations, and Kubernetes concepts. Content was written in Markdown format, published through GitHub, and rendered via GitBook's frontend.

You can also see architecture diagrams [here](diagrams.md), created with draw.io.
