# AbbVie
*September 2019 - August 2020*

## Key Projects

* Generated multiple key articles on healthcare concepts to be shared internally on company portal.
* Distributed monthly newsletters to full-time/corporate AbbVie personnel for an insight into the Innovation Center operations.
* Overhauled AbbVie onboarding materials in Confluence with instructional narrative and video scripts.
