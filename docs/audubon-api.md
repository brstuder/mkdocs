    Below is documentation for an API I conceived based on my personal experience and passion in wildlife biology. The project showcases design principles about certain parameters, explains best practices for querying the API, and includes specific use cases as demonstrations. If the concept interests you, there is a more user-friendly app for this purpose called [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) on your phone.

Audubon API is a conservation tool to catalog all sightings of wild bird species. It allows users to record details about a species including its physical descriptors, endangered status, and when it was last sighted. It also allows users to retrieve existing information for species logged by themselves or other users.

## Query Parameters

| Name            | Type      | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `name`          | string    | Full common name of the species written in longhand (e.g., “Northern Cardinal”). |
| `color`         | string    | Basic color(s) typically visible on the species. Supports comma-separated list for multiple colors (e.g., `red, brown`). See [Colors](#colors) for a full list of accepted color values. |
| `endangered`    | boolean   | Indicates whether the species is listed as endangered (`true` or `false`). Birds with a value of `endangered=true` should meet the [IUCN's definition of vulnerable](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) or a more severe categorization. |
| `size`          | string    | General size category of the species. Accepts: `tiny`, `small`, `medium`, or `large`. See [Estimating Size](#estimating-size) for a better understanding of how to use this parameter. |
| `migratory`     | boolean   | Indicates whether the species participates in seasonal migration. |
| `lastSpotted`     | string   | Indicates the last time the species was spotted and catalogued by a user. Only accepts dates formatted as `MM-DD-YY`. |

### Colors

Birds come in all different colors, and so the `color` parameter should be flexible to support multiple values for individual species. To add or query by multiple `color` values, use a comma-separated list (e.g. `red,white,black`). 

Supported values for `color` include: `white`, `black`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `indigo`, `violet`, `brown`, `pink`, and `gray`.

When calling the API by providing multiple color values, the API will only return logged species whose colors include the full list, not an individual color from the list. Use the `color` parameter only as restrictively as you need to. Additionally, as a best practice, avoid logging a new species with more than 2 colors to ensure it can be readily retrieved later. 

### Estimating Size

Without strict numerical boundaries, `size` is arguably subjective. However, there are key species comparisons (commonly observed birds you should already be familiar with) that serve as benchmarks for each `size` value. This allows users to remain consistent when providing these values across many species:

* `tiny`: For birds close in size to a sparrow, or smaller.
* `small`: For birds close in size to a robin.
* `medium`: For birds close in size to a raven.
* `large`: For birds close in size to a goose, or larger.

## Usage

### Logging a New Entry

It is recommended to provide a correct value for every single query parameter when a species is logged for the first time. If you are unsure if a species has been logged or not, you can first [query by its full common name](#filtering-for-individual-species)  to see if an entry has been created.

#### Example: Logging the American Robin into Audubon API for the first time:

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/audubon?name=American%20Robin&color=orange,gray,white&endangered=false&size=small&migratory=true&lastSpotted=11-22-25"
```

After logging a new species, we will receive an output that confirms all details about the new species were ingested successfully. An `id` value for that entry will also be created:

```py title="200: OK"
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Species successfully logged",
  "data": {
    "id": "a3f7c891-4d2e-4b3a-9f81-2c5e8b7d4a19",
    "name": "American Robin",
    "color": ["orange", "gray", "white"],
    "endangered": false,
    "size": "small",
    "migratory": true,
    "lastSpotted": "11-22-25",
    "createdAt": "2025-11-23T14:32:18Z"
  }
}
```

### Filtering for Species by Parameter(s)
When performing a `GET` request, you can include one or multiple query parameters to list all relevant logged species. This can be useful to identify a particular species by the provided physical descriptors, such as size and color.

#### Example: Querying for all yellow birds

We want to query the API for a list of all yellow birds. In this case, we only need to specify the `color` value.

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/audubon?color=yellow
```

The example output returns only three species, but you may see more, fewer, or different species altogether based on which species a user has logged.

```py title="200: OK"
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "3 species retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "b8e2d4c3-7a1f-4e9b-8c3d-5f6a9b2e1d4c",
      "name": "American Goldfinch",
      "color": ["yellow", "black"],
      "endangered": false,
      "size": "tiny",
      "migratory": true,
      "lastSpotted": "11-18-25",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-15T09:22:41Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "c9f3e5d4-8b2g-5f0c-9d4e-6g7b0c3f2e5d",
      "name": "Yellow Warbler",
      "color": ["yellow", "green"],
      "endangered": false,
      "size": "tiny",
      "migratory": true,
      "lastSpotted": "10-05-25",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-05T16:47:33Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "d0g4f6e5-9c3h-6g1d-0e5f-7h8c1d4g3f6e",
      "name": "Western Meadowlark",
      "color": ["yellow", "brown"],
      "endangered": false,
      "size": "small",
      "migratory": true,
      "lastSpotted": "11-20-25",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-12T11:03:29Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Example: Use the Audubon API to identify a recently spotted bird species

For this use case, we will use this commonly sighted water bird. You may already know its common full name, but if not, let's see if the Audubon API can help us out. The intent is to retrieve logs from other users in hopes we can deduce the correct species.

![image](images/bird.png)

From this bird's appearance, and from multiple encounters with this species, we can already provide multiple parameter values to help us out:

* We know the predominant colors are green and brown.
* We know the bird is closer in size to a crow than a robin or a goose.
* We have seen the bird multiple times, indicating it is likely not endangered.

With these details, we can call the Audubon API as such:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/audubon?color=green,brown&size=medium&endangered=false
```

```py title="200: OK"
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "3 species retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "e1h5g7f6-0d4i-7h2e-1f6g-8i9d2e5h4g7f",
      "name": "Green Heron",
      "color": ["green", "brown"],
      "endangered": false,
      "size": "medium",
      "migratory": true,
      "lastSpotted": "09-14-25",
      "createdAt": "2025-09-14T13:28:17Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "f2i6h8g7-1e5j-8i3f-2g7h-9j0e3f6i5h8g",
      "name": "Mallard",
      "color": ["green", "brown"],
      "endangered": false,
      "size": "medium",
      "migratory": true,
      "lastSpotted": "11-21-25",
      "createdAt": "2025-11-10T08:15:42Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "g3j7i9h8-2f6k-9j4g-3h8i-0k1f4g7j6i9h",
      "name": "Wood Duck",
      "color": ["green", "brown"],
      "endangered": false,
      "size": "medium",
      "migratory": true,
      "lastSpotted": "10-30-25",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-28T14:52:09Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

The Audubon API returns three species: Mallard, Green Heron, and Wood Duck. Two of these species are ducks, and one is a heron. From the image, we can safely determine the pictured species is not a duck. Therefore, we conclude the species must be a green heron (and we'd be correct!).

### Filtering for Individual Species

Because each logged species will have a unique `name` value (whereas all other parameters can be shared by multiple species), you should filter for an individual species by querying by its full common name.

`curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/audubon?name=American%20Robin"`

```py title="200: OK"
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Species retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "a3f7c891-4d2e-4b3a-9f81-2c5e8b7d4a19",
    "name": "American Robin",
    "color": ["orange", "gray", "white"],
    "endangered": false,
    "size": "small",
    "migratory": true,
    "lastSpotted": "11-22-25",
    "createdAt": "2025-11-23T14:32:18Z"
  }
}
```

Of course, each species has a unique `id` value that is created after being successfully logged, and therefore can be uniquely retrieved by calling the API with that value. That being said, the bird's common name may be easier to remember than a long string of digits.
