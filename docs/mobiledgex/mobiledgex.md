# MobiledgeX

*June 2021 - May 2022*

I worked at MobiledgeX, an edge computing startup, as my first full time role out of university. The experience, though short-lived (following [Google's acquisition and liquidation of the company](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/google-cloud-platform-acquires-mobileedgex--8fae7f2c)), provided me with valuable skills to function as an independent writer for my future roles. I wrote and revised software documentation using [Statamic](https://statamic.com/), a content management system tool.

As a tiny startup with roughly 40 team members, it is often expected to contribute in multiple ways. Beyond day-to-day documentation work, I also helped with minor design work for our docs website and external messaging using Adobe Photoshop. You can see some of my samples [here](../mobiledgex/design.md).
