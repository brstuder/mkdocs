# Graphic Design at MobiledgeX

We did not have a full-time graphic designer at MobiledgeX, and so I volunteered to assist with creating promotional graphics that could be shared across our different public-facing channels. These graphics all abided by MobiledgeX's internal branding and marketing standards. Graphics and icons were developed in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

MobiledgeX maintained an existing library of icons to be used, but I was able to generate custom icons which still conformed with their aesthetic.
