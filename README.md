# Welcome!

If you made it here, you likely already have the link to my online portfolio. If not, you can view it [here](https://brstuder.github.io/mkdocs/).

All of this content is open-source and was built by me from scratch (I had lots of qualified help along the way however). Over time this may serve as a testing ground for more advanced web elements I choose to integrate into my portfolio, so you can always check back for more updates.
